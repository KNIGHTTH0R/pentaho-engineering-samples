# Visualization API Bar/D3 Chart Sandbox

This folder contains the Bar/D3 visualization sample, at the sandbox stage. 

To quickly view the visualization in operation, execute `npm install` in this folder and open `index.html` through 
a local web-server (such as Python's, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`).
